In conjunction with Application Competition for Intelligent Reality (ACIR) of [IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Reality (ICIR)](https://icir.ieee.org)

### Overview

The Application Contest for Intelligent Reality (ACIR) challenges
developers to create AI machine learning *Intelligent Reality* (IR)
applications to provide realtime decision-making user experience with
analytics capability for the immersive (VR/AR/MR/XR) environment.

### Eligibility

The ACIR Competition is open to anyone interested in Intelligent Reality
development -- researchers, university students, hobbyists, or
professionals.

### Teams

You may register as a team (up to five persons per team) or an
individual.

### Instructions

Competition participants must meet the following guidelines:

-   All implementation must be based on the original work (existing or
    new are acceptable)
-   Include AI machine learning techniques and run within VR/AR/MR/XR
-   Be able to run on a cross-platform emulator for evaluation
-   Student must attend an accredited university (for students only)
-   Grant IEEE to post codes and data (if any) under public
    IEEE-ICIR-ACIR GitHub

### Evaluation criteria

1.  Quality of idea: creativity and originality
2.  Implementation of idea: user experience, design, and performance
3.  Potential impact on Intelligent Reality: deploy AI machine learning
    in VR/AR/MR/XR

### Awards

Winners (at the discretion of the Evaluation Team)

-   1st Place: up to \$1000 with 100 Ranking Points and IEEE certificate
-   2nd Place: up to \$500 with 50 Ranking Points and IEEE certificate
-   3rd Place: up to \$300 with 30 Ranking Points and IEEE certificate
-   All other submitters will receive 10 Ranking Points for
    participation

**Ranking Points: Accumulated points submitter earned through all
competitions**
